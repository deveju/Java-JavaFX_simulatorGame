# JavaFX-simulatorGame

##### Decided to post my first time trying JavaFX after a year learning Java.
##### It was a simple project to create a little game about life? I guess.
##### Made after watching tutorial videos from *thenewsboston* youtube channel, I watched until episode 7 before I started.
* Made with *IntelliJ IDEA Educational Edition 2022.2*.
