# JavaFX-firstProject
Decided to post my first time trying JavaFX after a year learning Java.
It was a simple project to create a little game about drugs... (actually not lol)
Made after watching tutorial videos from ***thenewsboston*** youtube channel, I watched until episode 7 before i started.
Made with **IntelliJ IDEA Educational Edition 2022.2**.
